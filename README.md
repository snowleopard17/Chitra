# Chitra
Mobile app made using flutter framework for Image Editing

# Motive
Module 3 game project HITS.

# HITS Task Description
I have done majority of task some couldn't do due to not having enough experience as well as a gap with native api support in flutter framework.
This app is really slow on emulator.

Not Working: File saving feature(This is really easy but I don't want to use thrid party on it but will use later if I want to complete this app)
Done 6 out of 9:
Unfinished and Reasons:
Image Segmentaion: Couldn't do due to no gpu support, possible with MLkit but that's not allowed.
Retouching: OpenCV api on flutter doesn't have retouching hence this also not possible.
Unsharp Masking: Can create a Bitmap and xor it will blured picture but operation on CPU will take more 7 seconds hence very inefficient
